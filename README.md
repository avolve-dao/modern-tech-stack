> Comprehensive documentation for building production-ready applications with the latest tools and frameworks

## Overview

This repository contains detailed analysis and implementation guides for the modern web and mobile development stack as of September 2025. The documentation is designed to be useful for both human developers and AI coding assistants.

## Core Technologies

### Frontend & Frameworks
- **Next.js 15.5** - React framework with Turbopack and Server Components
- **React 19.1** - Latest React with stable Server Components and Actions API
- **TypeScript 5.9** - Enhanced developer experience with 60% faster language server
- **Tailwind CSS v4** - Rust-powered Oxide engine with 100x faster builds

### Mobile Development
- **Expo SDK 54** - iOS 26 Liquid Glass support, 92% faster builds
- **React Native 0.81** - New Architecture as production standard
- **NativeWind v4** - Universal styling with 40% faster refresh times

### Backend & Infrastructure
- **Supabase** - Comprehensive backend with pgvector, queues, and edge functions
- **Vercel** - AI Cloud with Active CPU pricing and 90% cost savings
- **PostgreSQL 15+** - Advanced features with specialized extensions

### AI & Development Tools
- **Claude Code CLI** - Agentic coding with Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- **Vercel AI SDK 5.0** - 2M weekly downloads, unified AI model access
- **GitHub Copilot** - Enhanced React Native component generation

## Performance Highlights

- **97% faster cold starts** with Next.js 15.5 and Turbopack
- **96.3% faster Hot Module Replacement** for development
- **iOS builds reduced from 120s to 10s** with precompiled React Native
- **100x faster incremental builds** with Tailwind CSS v4 Oxide engine
- **Sub-100ms query latencies** with Supabase pgvector optimization

## Documentation Structure

- [`mobile-development.md`](./mobile-development.md) - React Native, Expo, and cross-platform development
- [`full-stack-development.md`](./full-stack-development.md) - Next.js, React, and modern web patterns
- [`web-capabilities.md`](./web-capabilities.md) - Infrastructure, AI tools, and platform services
- [`deployment/`](./deployment/) - Production deployment strategies and best practices
- [`examples/`](./examples/) - Code examples and implementation patterns

## Quick Start

```bash
# Create new AI-native Next.js project
npx create-next-app@latest --typescript --tailwind --app --src-dir

# Initialize Expo project with SDK 54
npx create-expo-app@latest --template blank-typescript

# Set up Supabase backend
npx supabase init && supabase start

# Configure AI development tools
npm install ai @ai-sdk/openai @ai-sdk/anthropic
```

## Critical Updates for 2025

### Urgent Migrations Required
- **Legacy Architecture removal in SDK 55** - Migrate to New Architecture immediately
- **Android edge-to-edge mandatory** - Update UI layouts for SDK 54
- **CodePush discontinued March 31, 2025** - Migrate to EAS Updates
- **Async request APIs in Next.js 15** - Update server-side data fetching

### Breaking Changes
- Next.js 15: fetch requests no longer cached by default
- React Native: New Architecture required for modern libraries
- Android 16: Edge-to-edge display mandatory
- iOS 26: Liquid Glass features require Xcode 26+

## Cost Optimization

- **Vercel Active CPU Pricing**: Up to 90% savings for I/O-bound workloads
- **Supabase Cached Egress**: 3x cost reduction at $0.03/GB
- **Static Generation**: 90% cost reduction vs SSR
- **Bundle Optimization**: 35% Vercel cost savings

## Enterprise Features

- SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA compliance options
- Row Level Security for fine-grained access control
- Invisible CAPTCHA protection against sophisticated bots
- OpenTelemetry support for comprehensive monitoring
- Rolling deployments with instant rollback capabilities
